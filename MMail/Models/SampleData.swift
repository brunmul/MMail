              Looks great so far. Two quick notes before we lock this in tomorrow:

              1. The empty state on step 2 still feels heavy. Can we drop the illustration and let the copy carry it?

              They're looking for a Staff Design lead for a new platform team. The compensation band is meaningfully higher than your current, and the work sounds genuinely interesting (zero-to-one prosumer thing in the design-tools adjacent space).

              Hi sweetie,

              Dad and I are flexible. If you're driving up Wednesday night the guest room is yours. Otherwise Thursday morning is fine.

              Let me know either way so I can plan the turkey timing. Also do you want me to invite Aunt Karen or is that going to be too much this year?

              Love,

              Hi,

              Loved the second direction. The logo lockup feels much more "us" than v1. A few small notes before we sign off:

              • The warm cream feels a touch too yellow on screen — can we cool it 3-5%?
              • The display weight on the wordmark is great. The italic alt feels less confident, can we drop it?
              • Business cards look 10/10, no changes needed.

              Otherwise we are good to go. Sending the deposit for the next phase today.

              Thanks!
              Elena

              Hey,

              We are putting together scope for a small marketing site refresh in July or August. Just a few pages, nothing crazy. Probably 4–6 weeks of design.

              Curious if you have any bandwidth that window? Happy to send the brief once I hear back.
